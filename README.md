# Space Courier

A small game concept I made in Godot to start getting (back) into gamedev. It's kinda like snake but in space! Built using Godot 4 Alpha 7.

I always struggle with scope creep when trying to get into a gamedev project, so this time I wanted to build something with the mindset of a gamejam. I had a week-plus vacation from work, so my goal was to build and publish a game before my vacation was over. By the end of the week, I had something that was playable with most of the art in place to boot, but I held off on publishing it until I got a few kinks ironed out. So, I didn't meet my original goal, but I still feel that this was a positive expierence overall!

Since that first week or so of progress, I've added music and sound effects, a few settings in the main menu, a few gameplay and visual tweaks, and some performance improvements. I also implemented controller support with help and contributions from @asheliahut!
